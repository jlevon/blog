Another request for sanity please. If I'm running a Linux distribution
less than 6 months old, it should be feasible to install your software
without installing random -svn versions of your dependencies.  
  
If it's not, I'm not going to bother trying out your software. That
means I definitely won't be fixing any of your bugs, and I'm pretty sure
I'm not alone. That means you lose out.  
  
Yes, this means you, [Review Board](http://www.review-board.org/). Is it
really so essential that you use a version of Django that isn't released
anywhere?
