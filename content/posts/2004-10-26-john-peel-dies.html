<p>
Pretty terrible news. John Peel was an excellent radio DJ, with an obvious passion for music. He was utterly
hapless at putting the records on at the right speed, and it was all part of the charm of his show. I always
kept meaning to listen to his R1 show more often, and now I don't get the chance.
