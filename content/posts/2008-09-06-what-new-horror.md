As I just noticed on the TV advert:  
  
<span class="black_Lg_txt"></span>

> <span class="black_Lg_txt">Universal Pictures will release a special
> sing-along edition of the hit movie musical *Mamma Mia!* in selected
> theaters nationwide</span>

I've thought of a worse thing than this though: a "wit-a-long" version
of Sex And The City.
