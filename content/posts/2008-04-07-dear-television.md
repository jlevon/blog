Probably the best short programme there is: [Dear
Television](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008yjcc). I love the
natural eccentricity of  
the type of person who would not only write to the BBC about some minor
thing about a TV  
programme, but choose as their bone of contention the parking practices
of fictional police drivers.  
  
Annoyingly it's not on iPlayer, or even anywhere else. Bah.
