They're using the phrase "a sense of" even more than they used to. They
refer to "the sense of jubilation" in the Democrat camp, or "a sense of
taking stock" amongst Republicans. Practically every other sentence uses
this moronic phrase. There's a real sense of lazy journalism at the
BBC.  
  
On the "moronic phrase" note: "Yes We Can" is just about the stupidest
campaign slogan ever.  
  
Also, the election coverage on the BBC was surprisingly biased. Way too
many left-leaning talking heads, very  
little positive coverage of the McCain campaign. It wasn't Fox News, of
course, but it was bad: I expected better from the BBC. It was almost
worth it to see John Bolton nearly explode with anger though.
