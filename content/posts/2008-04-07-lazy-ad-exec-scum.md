OK, maybe scum is a little over the top, but I really do hate how lazy
advertisers are.  
Current bone of contention being this advert:  
  

  
  
Now, whilst I don't think the Mighty Boosh crimping thing is at all
funny, it's still really annoying they would blatantly rip it off like
this. Just as bad is [the Berocca
ad](http://berocca.co.uk/ad/latest-tv-ad.htm). Their player doesn't seem
to work, but it totally rips off the infamous OK Go video:  
  

  
  
(I was also going to moan about [the Crusha
advert](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvEOjDeLWkA), but turns out Joel
actually did that one, so fair enough.)
