It boggles the mind that someone could get things so backwards. The
kernel exists to provide services to the outside world, not the other
way around. By all means criticise the details of the Xen dom0 code, but
this argument makes zero sense. How precisely did x86\_64 support
provide a technical benefit to the code base?
