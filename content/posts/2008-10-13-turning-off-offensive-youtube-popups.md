What the hell are they thinking? These awful
[popups](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VzQMdGwSnNs) have actually
genuinely achieved  
a new low: even pop-unders and nefarious crap like that have an obvious
way to dismiss the advert.  
Apparently it's also OK to just plaster them all over the content so you
can't even see it.  
  
You go to the arrow at the bottom right and click "Turn Off
Annotations". These are Annotations  
in the "Ministry Of Love" sense. Oh, you have to do that for every video
by the way. Unlike the  
volume control, which of course persists across all videos.  
  
Obviously, YouTube want you to hate them.
