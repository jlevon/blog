A significant portion of the Xen control tools are written in Python, in particular <tt>xend</tt>.
It's been somewhat awkward to observe what the daemon is doing at times, necessitating an endless
cycle of 'add printf; restart' cycles. A while ago I worked on adding DTrace support to the Python
packages we ship in OpenSolaris, and these changes have now made it into the latest build, 65.
</p>
<p>
As is the case with the other providers people have worked on such as Ruby and Perl, there's two
simple probes for function entry and function exit. <tt>arg0</tt> contains the filename, <tt>arg1</tt>
the function name, and <tt>arg2</tt> has the line number. So given this simple script to trace
the functions called by a particular function invocation, restricted to a given module name:
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -ZCs

#pragma D option quiet

python$target:::function-entry
    /copyinstr(arg1) == $2 && strstr(copyinstr(arg0), $1) != NULL/ {
        self->trace = 1;
}

python$target:::function-return
    /copyinstr(arg1) == $2 && strstr(copyinstr(arg0), $1) != NULL/ {
        self->trace = 0;
}

python$target:::function-entry,python$target:::function-return
    /self->trace && strstr(copyinstr(arg0), $3) != NULL/ {
        printf("%s %s (%s:%d)\n", probename == "function-entry" ? "->" : "<-",
            copyinstr(arg1), copyinstr(arg0), arg2);
}
</pre>
<p>
We can run it as follows and get some useful results:
</p>
<pre>
# ./pytrace.d \"hg.py\" \"clone\" \"mercurial\" -c 'hg clone /tmp/test.hg'
-> clone (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/hg.py:65)
-> repository (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/hg.py:54)
-> _lookup (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/hg.py:31)
-> _local (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/hg.py:16)
-> __getattribute__ (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/demandload.py:56)
-> module (build/proto/lib/python/mercurial/demandload.py:53)
...
</pre>
<p>
Of course, this being DTrace, we can tie all of this into general system activity as usual.
I also added "ustack helper" support. This is significantly more tricky to implement, but
enormously useful for following the path of Python code. For example, imagine we want to
look at what's causing write()s in the clone operation above. As usual:
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -Zs

syscall::write:entry /pid == $target/
{
        @[jstack(20)] = count();
}

END
{
        trunc(@, 2);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that we're using <tt>jstack()</tt> to make sure we have enough space allocated for the stack
strings reported. Now as well as the C stack, we can see what Python functions are involved in
the user stack trace:
</p>
<pre>
# ./writes.d -c 'hg clone /tmp/test.hg'

<h2>Creating a ustack helper</h2>

<p>
As anyone who's come across the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/source/browse/openjdk/jdk/trunk/hotspot/src/os/solaris/dtrace/jhelper.d?rev=227&amp;view=markup">
Java dtrace helper source</a> will know, creating a ustack helper is rather a black art.
</p>
<p>
When a ustack helper is present, it is called in-kernel for each entry in a stack when the <tt>ustack()</tt>
action occurs (<a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#5281">source</a>). The
D instructions in the helper action are executed such that the final string value is taken as the result of
the helper. Typically for Java, there is no associated C function symbol for the PC value at that point in the stack,
so the result of the helper is used directly in the stack trace. However, this is not true for Python, so that's
why you see a different format above: the normal stack entry, plus the result of the helper in annotated form where
it returned a result (in square brackets).
</p>
<p>
The helper is given two arguments: <tt>arg0</tt> is the PC value of the stack entry, and <tt>arg1</tt> is the frame pointer. The helper is expected to construct a meaningful string from just those values. In Python, the <tt>PyEval_EvalFrame</tt> function always has a <tt>PyFrameObject *</tt> as one of its arguments. By having the helper
look at this pointer value and dig around the structures, we can find pointers to the strings containing the file
name and function, as well as the line number. We can copy these strings in, and, using alloca() to give ourselves
some scratch space, build up the annotation string you see above.
</p>
<p>
Debugging helpers isn't particularly easy, since it lives and runs in probe context. You can use mdb's DTrace debugging
facilities to find out what happened, and some careful mapping between the failing D instructions and the helper
source can pinpoint the problem. Using this method it was relatively easy to get a working helper for x86 32-bit. Both SPARC and x86 64-bit proved more troublesome though. The problems were both related to the need to find the <tt>PyFrameObject *</tt> given the frame pointer. On amd64, the function we needed to trace was passing the arguments
in registers, as defined architecturally, so the argument wasn't accessible on the stack via the frame pointer. On SPARC, the pointer we need was stored in a register that was subsequently re-used as a scratch register. Both problems were solved, rather cheesily, by modifying the way the function was called.
