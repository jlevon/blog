I'm getting more than a little bit tired of Nintendo playing its bloody
games. Yes,  
we get it Nintendo, your stuff is popular. Now, please make enough
copies of  
Mario Kart and Wii Fit to sell them. It's not even Christmas.  
  
Mario Kart isn't even in shop charts. I've been past several shops
selling Wii  
stuff recently (Game, supermarkets, etc.) and most of them don't even
have any  
\*mention\* of Mario Kart. This is insane.  
  
Waaa.
