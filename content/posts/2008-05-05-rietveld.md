Google have released [rietveld](http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/),
inspired by their internal code-review tool. The video  
about Mondrian made it look pretty (i.e. incredibly) useful for code
review. The released  
version already [looks pretty
nifty](http://codereview.appspot.com/842/diff/1/22).
[webrev](http://cr.opensolaris.org/%7Ejohnlev/lofi-mount/) works great
for my day job, but it would be  
awfully nice to be able to store comments too. I'd love to see rietveld
get adopted, though  
there's some tweaks I'd like to see...
