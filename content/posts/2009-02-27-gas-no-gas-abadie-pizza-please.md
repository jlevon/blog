Well this makes no sense:  
  
Me: "Hi, your letter said I needed to arrange a visit with you to check
the gas safety of my flat."  
Them: "That's right, what's your details?"  
<span style="font-style: italic;">\*gives them\*</span>  
Me: "There's no gas supply in the building, but apparently you have to
come see that in person yourselves."  
Them: "Yes, that's true. .... OK, we'll send you a letter with the
appointment details."  
Me: "Uh, I can't just do any time, it needs to be arranged."  
Them: "That's OK - if you can't make the appointment on the letter, then
you can ring us up after you receive it and tell us."  
Me: "..."
