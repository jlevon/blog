It's somewhat disappoint that Mercurial is [still corrupting
repositories when you interrupt MQ
operations](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/bts/issue1216).  
  
Relatively easily recoverable for me this time, thankfully. I'd still
like to see <span style="font-family: courier new;">hg backup from the
[OpenSolaris SCM
project](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/scm-migration/) get
merged upstream though :)</span>
