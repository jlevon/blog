[Is CHRISTIAN electronic music the new
underground?](http://www.technochristian.com/the-new-underground/)  
  
<span style="font-style: italic;">"It used to be that all of the good
new music was in the rave scene and then would trickle out into the
internet and store shelves. Now when I look for traditional electronic
music anywhere, I find that the music seems generally boring or has too
much of a political or sinful feel."</span>  
  
I hate that traditional electronic boring, political, or sinful music
too.
