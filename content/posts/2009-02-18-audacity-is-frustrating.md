You might think that recording and then splitting it into separate audio
files based on silences  
between each track would be easy to do - sadly not.  
  
Aside from crashing a few times and failing to recover properly, I've
been hit by these  
enormous frustrations:  
  
- despite claims to the contrary, even 1.3.7 does not correctly alter
labels when you modify the  
audio. That means there's no way to Truncate Silence without re-doing
all your labels!  
- you can't split into tracks (or, apparently, make selections) based on
labels added by the silence finder, so you can't remove inter-track
silences that way either  
- the labels dialog has a fun bug where it removes all your labels that
don't have names (as  
none of them do by default). This gets frustrating fast.  
- there's no way to start a recording on the current track - I have to
have a new one, it seems. This was fine until I discovered that Mix and
Render completely screwed up the merging of all the tracks.  
  
Seriously, how do people actually use this thing?
