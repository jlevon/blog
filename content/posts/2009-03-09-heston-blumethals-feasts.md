I've just watched last week's episode of this series, Heston
Blumenthal's Victorian Feast. The guy is the epitome of the mad
scientist (his dessert was strawberry, elderflower and absinthe dildo
jelly with earl grey ice cream).  
  
I had one of his inventions a while back: strawberry, olive and leather
vanilla sundae. It was pretty nice, though the rather more staid
chocolate wine popsicle was much nicer.  
  
You should watch Tuesday's...
