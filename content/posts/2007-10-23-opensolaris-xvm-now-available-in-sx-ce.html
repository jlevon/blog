Build 75 of Solaris Express Community Edition is <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/sol_ex_dvd/">now out</a>,
and it includes <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/on/flag-days/pages/2007091801/">our bits</a>. So go
ahead, install build 75, select the xVM entry in grub and play around! We're still working on updating the documentation
on <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/xen/">our community page</a>; in the meantime, you have manpages - start at <tt>xVM(5)</tt> (and note that the forthcoming build 76 has much improved versions of those docs).

You might be wondering if your machine is capable of running Windows or other operating systems under HVM. Joe Bonasera
has a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/JoeBonasera/entry/detecting_hardware_virtualization_support_for">simple program</a>
you can run that will tell you. Alternatively, if you're already running with our bits, running 'virt-install' will
tell you - if it asks you about creating a fully-virtualized domain, then it should work, and you can end up with a 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/rab/entry/windows_on_solaris">desktop like Russell Blaine's</a>.

Nils, meanwhile, describes how we've improved the RAS of the hypervisor by integrating it with Solaris crash dumps
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/nilsn/">here</a>. This feature has saved our lives numerous times during development as those of us who've done the "hex dump" debugging thing know very well.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we're not done yet - we have bugs to fix and rough edges to smooth out, and we have significant features to implement. One of the major items we're working on in the near future is the upgrade to Xen 3.1.1 (or possibly 3.1.2, depending on timelines!). This will give us the ability to do live migration of HVM domains, along with a host of other features and improvements.
