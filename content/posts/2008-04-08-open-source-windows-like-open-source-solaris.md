[etbe](http://advogato.org/person/etbe/diary/309.html): I'm confused by
your comments in that opinion article - were you misquoted? How did
"advised by your lawyer not to look at code" become "OpenSolaris isn't
FOSS" ? BTW, whenever you ask a lawyer a can-I question, they'll always
tell you no :) I'm presuming you're not willing to share the details of
this legal opinion.
