Via [davej](http://kernelslacker.livejournal.com/117121.html): "There
are no managers at [Centaur](http://www.centtech.com/company.htm).
Instead, employees report to Centaur founder and President, Glenn
Henry".  
  
There are 85 employees there [according to
Google](http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=14252245). It sounds like
living hell to me. Maybe all of those people are both really competent
and really nice, but I find it a bit difficult to believe.
