Apparently applications should be prepared to lose 60 minutes of data to
[work around the file system
now](http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2009/03/15/dont-fear-the-fsync/).  
  
Of course the notion that application should have explicit load/save
operations is a
[nonsense](http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interface-Design/dp/1568843224)
already. Now we should "fix" one of the few places that never had this
(ever seen a browser where you have to save your bookmarks explicitly
when you quit?) to expose this implementation detail in a data-losing
way again.
