In this post, I'm going to give a quick walk through the major changes we've made so far in doing
our port of Solaris to the Xen "platform". As we've only supplied a tarball of the source tree
so far, I can't hyperlink to the relevant bits - sorry about that.
As our code is still under heavy development, you can expect some of this code organisation to change significantly; nonetheless I thought this might be useful for those interested in peeking into the internals of what we've done so far.
</p>

<p>
As you might expect, the vast majority of the changes we've made reside in the kernel. To support
booting Solaris under Xen (both domU and dom0, though as we've said the latter is still in the very
early stages of development), we've introduced a new platform based on <tt>i86pc</tt> called <tt>i86xen</tt>. Wherever
possible, we've tried to share common code by using <tt>i86pc</tt>'s sources. There's still some cleanup
we can do in this area.
</p>

<p>
Within <tt>usr/src/uts/i86xen</tt>, there are a number of Xen-specific source files:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>io/psm/</tt></dt>
<dd>
Contains the PSM ("Platform-Specific Module") module for Xen. This mirrors the PSM provided by <tt>i86pc</tt>,
but deals with the hypervisor-provided features such as the clock timer and the events system.
</dd>

<dt><tt>io/xendev/</tt></dt>
<dd>
This contains the virtual root nexus driver "xendev". All of the virtual frontend drivers are connected to this.
</dd>

<dt><tt>io/xvbd/</tt></dt>
<dd>
The virtual block driver. It's currently non-functional with the version of Xen we're working with; we're working
hard on getting it functional.
</dd>

<dt><tt>os/</tt></dt>
<dd>
The guts of the kernel/hypervisor code. Amongst other things, it provides interfaces for dealing with events in
<tt>evtchn.c</tt> and <tt>hypervisor_machdep.c</tt> (the hypervisor version of virtual interrupts, which hook into Solaris's standard interrupt system), the grant table in <tt>gnttab.c</tt> (used for providing access/transfer of pages between frontend and backend, suspend/resume in <tt>xen_machdep.c</tt>, and support routines for the debugger and the MMU code (<tt>mach_kdi.c</tt> and <tt>xen_mmu.c</tt> respectively).
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
As mentioned we use the <tt>i86pc</tt> code where possible, occasionally using <tt>#ifdef</tt>s where minor differences
are found. In particular we re-use the <tt>i86pc</tt> HAT (MMU management) code found in <tt>i86pc/vm</tt>. You can
also find code for the new boot method <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/JoeBonasera/20060213">described by Joe Bonasera</a> in <tt>i86pc/dboot</tt> and <tt>i86pc/boot</tt>.
</p>

<p>
A number of drivers that are needed by Xen but aren't <tt>i86xen</tt> specific live under <tt>usr/src/uts/common</tt>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>common/io/xenbus_*.c common/io/xenbus/</tt></dt>
<dd>
"xenbus" is a simple transport for configuration data provided by domain0; for example, it provides a node <tt>control/shutdown</tt> which will notify the domainU that the user has requested the domain to be shutdown
(or suspended) from domain0's management tools. This code provides this support.
</dd>

<dt><tt>common/io/xencons/</tt></dt>
<dd>
The virtual console frontend driver.
</dd>

<dt><tt>common/io/xennetf/</tt></dt>
<dd>
The virtual net device frontend driver.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
As you might expect, the userspace changes we've needed to make so far have been reasonably minimal. Despite supporting
the new <tt>i86xen</tt> platform definition, the only significant changes have been to <tt>usr/src/cmd/mdb/</tt>,
where we've added some changes to better support debugging of the Xen-style x86 MMU.
