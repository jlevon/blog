I can't quite get over how arrogant [his
talk](http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/lpc_2008_keynote.html?seemore=y)
was. If you're not sending in kernel patches, that means you're bad and
all your developers should get jobs elsewhere, apparently. Things like
HAL aren't "Linux plumbing", and if you contribute to that, or GNOME in
general, tough luck, since other operating systems can use it. GCC,
binutils, and X.org are OK though, because, well ... just because.
