For some reason only just now getting around to listening to [Fujiya &
Miyagi](http://www.fujiya-miyagi.co.uk/) album, though I've got a couple
of their 10"s. They're on [Tirk](http://www.tirk-recordings.com/), which
obviously means they're great by default. If you like LCD Soundsystem or
!!!, or whatever, and that, go get the album. I liked it so much I
bought it twice. Admittedly by accident, but still.
