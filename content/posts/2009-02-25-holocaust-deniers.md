Somewhat unpleasantly, I'm a vague acquaintance of a couple of holocaust
deniers (in the sense that I've been in the same place as them once or
twice). Really <span style="font-style: italic;">weird</span> people:  

1.  They always bring it up at parties. Seriously, what? If I were a
    terrorism expert, I'd tend to keep off the subject at parties, since
    people might see it as a little sensitive. Even if I was just a huge
    fan of He-Man or something I'd probably only mention it if we were
    talking about 1980s kids' TV. Why do they always start talking about
    it?
2.  It's never a slight correction. It's always some ridiculous figure
    they claim, like "zero" or "thousands". Surely if the figures are
    really dubious, they're not going to be 6 million off? It's
    equivalent to claiming that nobody lives in Libya.
3.  They appear to believe in either the most expertly executed hoax of
    all time, and their only apparent response to this is to moan about
    it to people they don't know. How does that make any sense?
