When OpenSolaris got started, #solaris was a channel filled with pointless rants about GNU-this
and Linux-that. Beside complete wrong-headedness, it was a total waste of time and extremely
hostile to new people. #opensolaris, in contrast, was actually pretty nice (for IRC!) - sure,
the usual pointless discussions but it certainly wasn't hateful.

Recently I'm sad to say #opensolaris has become a really hostile, unpleasant place. 
I've seen new people arrive and be bullied by a
small number of <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8673">poisonous
people</a> until they went away (nice own goal, people!). So if anyone's
looking for me for xVM stuff or whatever, I'll be in #onnv-scm or #solaris-xen as usual. And if you
do so, please try to keep a civil tongue in your head - it's not hard.
