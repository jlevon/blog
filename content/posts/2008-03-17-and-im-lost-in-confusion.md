I've moved my blog to
[blogspot.com](http://bandmoreagain.blogspot.com/), so I can add
pictures and the like without having to bugger about too much as I did

Just back from the US. Somehow I spent 3 weeks there last time without
noticing my hotel was practically next to [Rasputin
Music](http://www.rasputinmusic.com/sanfran.html). Anyway, I finally did
this time on Saturday morning and thankfully had time to do some
shopping. At the exchange rate, the 2-disc 12" of Underworld's Jumbo was
a particularly good buy, though I was most excited over this:

That's the 12" of [Trash](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Whip/_/Trash).
Yes, I went all the way to the US to get a record by a local Manchester
band. I missed it first time around, and they're all bought up over
here, so I think that's why I didn't own it yet. But it's a great tune.
