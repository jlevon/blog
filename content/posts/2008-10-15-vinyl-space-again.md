After Habitat stupidly stopped selling the storage I was using for my
records, I finally found  
something suitable for the size of my flat:  
  
[![](../images/thumbnails/2008-10-15-vinyl-space-again-P9240001.JPG)](../images/2008-10-15-vinyl-space-again-P9240001.JPG)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
These are [i-cubes](http://www.i-cubes.co.uk/). Not the most beautiful
storage in the world, but I have expansion room again!
