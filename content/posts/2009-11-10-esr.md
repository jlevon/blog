“The main indicators of egotism as I intend it here are are loud
self-display, insecurity, constant approval-seeking, overinflating one’s
accomplishments, touchiness about slights, and territorial twitchiness
about one’s expertise. My claim is that egotism is a disease of the
incapable, and vanishes or nearly vanishes among the super-capable.”  

  
“I’m the crippled kid who became a black-belt martial artist and teacher
of martial artists. I’ve made the New York Times bestseller list as a
writer. You can hardly use a browser, a cellphone, or a game console
without relying on my code. I’ve been a session musician on two records.
I’ve blown up the software industry once, reinvented the hacker culture
twice, and am without doubt one of the dozen most famous geeks alive.”
