Yes, it's a pointless end of year list! In no particular order.  
Much of this stuff is by no means new in 2008, but it's all new to me in
2008.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sailor Jerry's</span>  
  
Old news to most by now but the popularity of combining this
vanilla-flavoured rum with coke and ice has yet to wane.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FFV</span>  
  
Imported via a visit to Helsinki earlier in the year, Fisherman's Friend
Vodka (both its name, and its recipe) took the world\* by storm, and
continues to delight.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Helsinki Travel Theodolites</span>  
  
Jim Beam's, Disaronno, Coke, Ice and a slice of lime.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">David Thomas Broughton versus 7
Hertz</span>  
  
"Can't afford a pasty from Gregg's bakery". Still loving this album. His
singing voice is an acquired taste, but I acquired it. I also admire
anyone who doesn't let their equipment blowing up stop them putting the
song onto the CD.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds - Dig
Lazarus Dig</span>  
  
Reminded me that I do actually really like Nick Cave.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cut Copy - In Colours</span>  
  
Uncomplicated but enjoyable electro. A New Order I like.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Primal Scream - Swastika Eyes
(live)</span>  
  
Entire audience hated it, but it was the only good bit in the whole gig.
Still think they're crap.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Trentemoller @ The Big Chill</span>  
  
I knew he'd be astonishing, because all his productions, and all his
remixes, are astonishing. He was.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Leonard Cohen @ The Big Chill</span>  
  
The world is thanking his bent accountant for this tour.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There Will Be Blood</span>  
  
It's not exactly a stretch for me to like a Paul Anderson film, but
still...  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Atonement</span>  
  
To my shame, I saw the film before the book, but I thought both were
brilliant. Yes, even Keira Knightley.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No Country For Old Men</span>  
  
I was expecting to be bored crapless by this but was mesmerised
instead.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Shield Season 7</span>  
  
This final season knocked this back up to seriously rival The Wire for
best thing ever. The entire season exulted in reminding you that Vic
Mackey was a truly horrible person.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sons Of Anarchy</span>  
  
A drama about gun-running Californian bikers sounds dumb, but this was
brilliantly done. For some reason I kept being reminded of Cher though -
that is never good.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abode</span>  
  
Very, very, good restaurant 2 minutes from my flat == yay.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Try Thai</span>  
  
Very good value, with excellent battered scallops, in Chinatown (if you
can call a single square a town (which you can't, Manchester -
sorry)).  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Deaf Institute</span>  
  
Well done for opening, Trof 3!  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sam Smith's Organic Ale</span>  
  
I drank way too much of this.

Light</span>](http://www.allgatesbrewery.com/hospice.htm)  
  
And nowhere near enough of this.
