<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mabbott/20040614#where_s_my_linux_desktop">Micah Abbott</a> complains
that there isn't an internal push for people to use JDS/Linux on their desktops. I suppose they missed the
"JDS challenge", an effort to install JDS as much as possible. Also ISTR there have been a few
JDS install-fests.

Micah: the date/time bug has long since been fixed (it's bug 4852615). And I'm afraid that Mozilla is no
less crash-prone on Linux than it is on Solaris (believe me...).

Linux is great but I'm not sure how you reached the conclusion you needed it based on a fixed bug, one that hasn't anything
to do with Solaris, and having an ancient machine :)
