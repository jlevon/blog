After <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/xen-discuss/2007-July/001011.html">answering a query</a>, I
said I'd write a blog entry describing what changes we've made to support clean shutdown and start of Xen domains.
</p>
<p>
Bernd refers to an older method of auto-starting Xen domains used on Linux. In fact, this method has been replaced
with the configuration parameters <tt>on_xend_start</tt> and <tt>on_xend_stop</tt>. Setting these can ensure
that a Xen domain is cleanly shut down when the host (dom0) is shut down, and started automatically as needed. For
somewhat obvious reasons, we'd like to have the same semantics as used with zones, if not quite the same implementation
(yet, at least).
</p>
<p>
When I started looking at this, I realised that the community solution had some problems:
</p>
<h3>Clean shutdown wasn't the default</h3>
<p>
It seems obvious that by default I'd like my operating systems to shut down cleanly. Only in unusual circumstances would
I be happy with an OS being unceremoniously destroyed. We modified our Xen gate to default to <tt>on_xend_stop=shutdown</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Suspend on shutdown was dangerous</h3>
<p>
It is possible to specify <tt>on_xend_stop=suspend</tt>; this will save the running state to an image file and then destroy the domain (like <tt>xm save</tt>). However, there is not corresponding <tt>on_xend_start</tt> setting, nor
any logic to ensure that the values match. This is both apparently useless and even dangerous, since starting a new
domain but with old file-system state from a suspended domain could be problematic. We've disabled this functionality.
</p>

<h3>Actions are tied into xend</h3>
<p>
This was the biggest problem for us: as modelled, if somebody stops <tt>xend</tt>, then all the domains would be shut down. Similarly, if <tt>xend</tt> restarts for whatever reason (say, a hardware error), it would start domains again.
We've modified this on Solaris. Instead of <tt>xend</tt> operating on these values, we introduce a new SMF service,
<a href="http://movementarian.org/solaris-xen/xen-gate/sunos.hg/src/svc/xctl-domains"><tt>system/xctl/domains</tt></a>,
that auto-starts/stops domains as necessary. 
This service is pretty similar to <tt>system/zones</tt>. We've set up the <a href="http://movementarian.org/solaris-xen/xen-gate/sunos.hg/src/svc/domains.xml">dependencies</a> such that a restart
of the Xen daemons won't cause any running domains to be restarted. For this to work properly within the SMF
framework, we also had to modify <tt>xend</tt> to wait for all domains to finish their state transitions.
</p>

<p>
You can find our changes <a href="http://movementarian.org/solaris-xen/xen-gate/xen.hg/.hg/patches/hack-domain-autostart">here</a>. And yes,
we still need to take <tt>system/xctl/domains</tt> to PSARC.
</p>

<h2>Clean shutdown implementation</h2>
<p>
You might be wondering how the dom0 even asks the guest domains to shut down cleanly. This is done via a xenstore
entry, <tt>control/shutdown</tt>. The control tools write a string into this entry, which is being "watched" by
the domain. The kernel then reads the value and responds appropriately 
(<a href="http://movementarian.org/solaris-xen/usr/src/uts/i86xpv/os/xen_machdep.c">xen_shutdown()</a>),

triggering a <a href="http://movementarian.org/solaris-xen/xen-gate/sunos.hg/src/scripts/xpvsys-event">user-space script</a> via the sysevent framework. If nothing happens for a while, it's possible that the script couldn't run
for whatever reason. In that case, we time-out and force a "dirty" shutdown from within the kernel.
